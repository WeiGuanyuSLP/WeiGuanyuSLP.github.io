My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I am a PhD student in the Communication Sciences program at Case Western Reserve University, OH, United States. I aim to share a brief overview of my projects and experience on this website.\nAs a bilingual speech-language pathologist, my research focus has been primarily on counseling aspects of speech-language pathology (SLP) and health disparities. During my undergraduate and graduate training, I have actively sought opportunities to develop professionally. One such activity includes the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association’s Minority Student Leadership Program (MSLP), a highly selective program intended to support future leaders from historically underrepresented backgrounds in communication disorders clinical and research careers and the Pennsylvania Leadership and Advocacy Network funded by the Pennsylvania Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Through these two programs, I honed my leadership and networking skills and gained a deeper understanding of the need for minority leaders and representatives in the field of healthcare. To be specific, for example, currently available assessment and treatment tools are primarily designed for individuals who are native (and often monolingual) speakers of English. In an effort to alleviate health disparities and improve the accessibility of evidence-based approaches, I have actively collaborated with clinicians and researchers from China and Canada to improve the accessibility of these assessments to include versions in Mandarin Chinese. I have had multiple opportunities to present my research at state and national conferences in the US on these topics. In addition, I was invited to speak at a hospital in China to discuss updates and insights in the field of speech-language pathology in both China and the US. To date, I have two published manuscripts, one published thesis, two manuscripts in review, and three projects in progress. All of my research projects are related to my long-term goal of contributing to an evidence-based treatment program for individuals with acquired brain injury that is accessible to individuals who speak English and/or Mandarin Chinese.\n\nContact me"
